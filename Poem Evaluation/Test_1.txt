1. 
The first true sign of love is anger:
What we need, we're likely to resent.
Each needing, needed, leaned on, leaning,
No longer free standing stone and white.
The wistful, tender fear of finity
Yields a darker shimmer of sublimity.
Now indeed some sunny, delicate blight
Inaugurates a subterranean keening.
None can turn away and not be bent,
Each in each part self, part untouched stranger.

2.
I buried my father in my heart.
Now he grows in me, my strange son,
My little root who won’t drink milk,
Little pale foot sunk in unheard-of night,
Little clock spring newly wet
In the fire, little grape, parent to the future
Wine, a son the fruit of his own son,
Little father I ransom with my life.

3.
The difference between love and lust is:
Only thus do lovers spin their bliss.
To love and be loved two must give,
And makes a worship out of all endeavor,
Like walking in the sunshine to a song,
Lose yourself in lust, my love;
You think about all you might miss
As for my heart it will not endeavour

4.
You wrote your name upon her thigh
We and the labouring world are passing by:
You can't both love and freedom chase,
In the end, love burns not desire but fear.
Why, what could she have done being what she is?
What turn did I miss after some kiss
Lovers aren't always best of friends:
But now I would be something more than friends.

5.
Every life has a room
where memories are stored:
A box of special occasions here,
Shelves of shared laughter there.
But back in the shadows
Lurks a trunk locked tight,
Not to be opened and searched.
There hide disappointments
Which darken every heart.

6.
Let me sing you a love song
About what I feel in my heart;
Butterflies can't find nectar
Whenever we're apart.
You're a flower in bloom.
In the dark, in the gloom,
It's you who brightens my day.
How many ways do I need you?
Every day, every way, come what may.

7.
To understand how much we are in need.
Your eyes are icy springs that feed
So dream with me these empty months of sorrow
But you will heal to love again tomorrow.
We cannot see what most we'd like to know.
When you're away I miss you so
That blows right through the person that you see.
And you are more high of heart than she

8.
There’s a light inside my heart
that always lights the way;
A glimmer of hope that
gets me through the day;
A little ray of happiness,
that somehow gets me through
the bad times and the sad time
That little light is you.

You’re the light inside my heart,
the love that lights the way.

9.
The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean,
The winds of Heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single,
All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle -
Why not I with thine?

10.
That someone in your happiness
And why you cannot cherish who I am,
Are seized by extraordinary happiness and pain,
Bearing death and pain?
Nor will you know till it vanishes again.
Dreams do come true, but only when
It holds the triumph of a secured marriage;
You and I alone, joined at the root.

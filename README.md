# Poem_Generator
UKZN COMP 316 (Natural Language Processing) Semester project - 2016

Coded in eclipse using Java 8. Includes only the src folder of the eclipse project.

This project requires JWI (Java WordNet Interface) using WordNet 3.1, and the Stanford CoreNLP Library(2015). Both libraries need to be present in the project folder - or edit file paths in the wrapper classes for exception safety.
